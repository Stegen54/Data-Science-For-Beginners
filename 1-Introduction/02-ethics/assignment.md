## Write A Data Ethics Case Study

## Instructions

You've learned about various [Data Ethics Challenges](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) and seen some examples of [Case Studies](README.md#3-case-studies) reflecting data ethics challenges in real-world contexts.

In this assignment, you'll write your own case study reflecting a data ethics challenge from your own experience, or from a relevant real-world context you are familiar with. Just follow these steps:

1. `Pick a Data Ethics Challenge`. Look at [the lesson examples](README.md#2-ethics-challenges) or explore online examples like [the Deon Checklist](https://deon.drivendata.org/examples/) to get inspiration.

2. `Describe a Real World Example`. Think about a situation you have heard of (headlines, research study etc.) or experienced (local community), where this specific challenge occurred. Think about the data ethics questions related to the challenge - and discuss the potential harms or unintended consequences that arise because of this issue. Bonus points: think about potential solutions or processes that may be applied here to help eliminate or mitigate the adverse impact of this challenge.

3. `Provide a Related Resources list`. Share one or more resources (links to an article, a personal blog post or image, online research paper etc.) to prove this was a real-world occurrence. Bonus points: share resources that also showcase the potential harms & consequences from the incident, or highlight positive steps taken to prevent its recurrence.



## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One or more data ethics challenges are identified. <br/> <br/> The case study clearly describes a real-world incident reflecting that challenge, and highlights undesirable consequences or harms it caused. <br/><br/> There is at least one linked resource to prove this occurred. | One data ethics challenge is identified. <br/><br/> At least one relevant harm or consequence is discussed briefly. <br/><br/> However discussion is limited or lacks proof of real-world occurence. | A data challenge is identified. <br/><br/> However the description or resources do not adequately reflect the challenge or prove it's real-world occurence. |

  # The Use of Personal Data in Kenya's Huduma Namba Initiative

In 2019, the Kenyan government launched the Huduma Namba initiative, a national biometric identification system aimed at consolidating personal information from various government databases into one central registry. While the initiative promised to streamline government services and improve efficiency, it also raised significant data ethics concerns, particularly regarding privacy, data security, and informed consent.

# Background

The Huduma Namba initiative, officially known as the National Integrated Identity Management System (NIIMS), required citizens to provide extensive personal information, including biometric data such as fingerprints and facial recognition data. The primary objective was to create a single source of personal identification to improve access to government services, reduce fraud, and enhance national security.

# Data Ethics Concerns

1. Privacy and Surveillance:
   - Issue: Critics argued that the Huduma Namba system could lead to increased government surveillance and misuse of personal data.
   - Case in Point: Concerns were raised about the potential for the government to track citizens without their consent, leading to a loss of privacy.

2. Data Security:
   - Issue: The centralization of sensitive personal data in one database heightened the risk of data breaches and cyber-attacks.
   - Case in Point: There were apprehensions about the government's ability to safeguard the data against hackers, given past incidents of data breaches in Kenya.

3. Informed Consent:
   - Issue: The registration process did not adequately inform citizens about how their data would be used, stored, and protected.
   - Case in Point: Many Kenyans reported feeling coerced into registering, as there were implications that non-compliance would result in denial of essential services.

4. Legal and Regulatory Framework:
   - Issue: At the time of implementation, Kenya lacked comprehensive data protection laws to regulate the collection, storage, and use of personal data.
   - Case in Point: The Data Protection Act was enacted only later in 2019, after the initial rollout of the Huduma Namba, raising questions about the legality and ethicality of the data collection practices.

# Outcomes and Responses

- Public Outcry and Legal Challenges: Civil society organizations and privacy advocates filed lawsuits challenging the legality and ethical implications of the Huduma Namba system. They argued that the system violated constitutional rights to privacy.
- Court Ruling: In 2020, Kenya's High Court ruled that the government must halt the collection of DNA and GPS data under the Huduma Namba system and ensure robust data protection measures were in place before proceeding.
- Legislative Action: Following the court ruling, the government accelerated the implementation of the Data Protection Act, aimed at providing a framework for the protection of personal data and regulating its processing.



# Lessons Learned

1. Necessity of Robust Legal Frameworks: The case underscores the importance of having strong data protection laws in place before the implementation of large-scale data collection initiatives.
2. Transparency and Public Engagement: Governments must ensure transparency in how data will be used and engage the public meaningfully to foster trust and compliance.
3. Balancing Innovation and Ethics: While technological advancements can enhance service delivery, they must be balanced with ethical considerations to protect citizens' rights.

# Conclusion

The Huduma Namba initiative highlights the complex interplay between technological innovation and data ethics. As African countries continue to adopt digital solutions, it is crucial to address ethical challenges proactively to safeguard citizens' rights and ensure the responsible use of data.
